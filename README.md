In order to run this program on the student machine, the user must include the
-Y flag when they ssh into the machine, as follows: ssh -Y 
netID@student00.cse.nd.edu. With the -Y flag included, all code should run. 
However, the appear the GUI is improved when running locally on macOS. 

Additionally, the measure file needs to be compiled for your operating system so 
it is recommend you do a make clean and recompile before running. 

Finally, in order to run the test, the user should have valigrind installed in
order to check for memory leaks, uninitialized  memory and invalid memory access. 

For individual contribution, we met many times all together in Duncan and worked
through the logic of the program and integration of the GUI as one. Rick did the
coding on his computer as we all made desicions on how to best structure our 
program.
